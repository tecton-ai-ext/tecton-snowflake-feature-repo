    "\n",
    "By default, new \"development\" workspaces do not have access to materialization and storage resources. Instead, transformations can be run ad-hoc in your Snowflake Warehouse. This means that the Tecton SDK builds a query that reads directly from your raw data tables, and executes it in your Snowflake Warehouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ad-hoc computation functionality can be used in any workspace and allows you to easily test features without needing to backfill and materialize data to the Feature Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "New workspaces with full materialization and storage resources can be created with the addition of the _--live_ flag during create time in the below CLI command.
